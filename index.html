            Pharaohs were ancient Egyptian rulers who were both religious leaders and heads of state. 
            Their importance in Ancient Egypt is undeniably paramount.
            Early Egyptian rulers were called kings but over time the name 'Pharaoh' became commonly used.
            The Pharaoh represents a middle intermediary between the Egyptians and the Gods.
            They are considered divine supreme beings...</p> </div>

            Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered in 1922 by excavators led by Howard Carter. As a result of the quantity
            and spectacular appearance of the burial goods, the tomb attracted a media frenzy and became the most famous
            find in the history of Egyptology. The death of Carter's patron, the Earl of Carnarvon, in the midst of the
            excavation process inspired speculation that the tomb was cursed. The discovery produced only limited
            evidence about the history of Tutankhamun's reign and the Amarna Period that preceded it, but it provided
            insight into the material culture of wealthy ancient Egyptians as well as patterns of ancient tomb robbery.
            Tutankhamun became one of the best-known pharaohs, and some artefacts from his tomb, such as his golden
            funerary mask, are among the best-known artworks from ancient Egypt.
